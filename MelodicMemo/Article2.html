                        Are they worth it when Spotify and iTunes exist? Some people buy vinyl records for the aesthetic
                        and others to have a professional rare albums collection. But why? Can’t they find them as audios
                        online?

                        The feeling of having a physical vinyl that you can play on an old school record player is magical
                        somehow. When starting a collection, at first it was just collecting your favourites but in someway it
                        turns into an obsession to buy full collections just to say you have them (let’s be honest … we all do
                        this). It is important to try latest music and vinyl records help you with that.

                        When buying a vinyl record that has one song you know, there is a chance you’ll here the rest of the
                        album and enjoy it. On streaming platforms, you listen to that one song and don’t open up to the
                        music the rest of the album has to offer.
                        Really the whole purpose of vinyl records now a days is to have collections. But it is still magical
                        owning a hard copy of a song. Can you believe a song plays out of a plastic disk with lines grooved in
                        it?

                        Overall, vinyl records are for the responsible and are definitely worth it especially to try new genres
                        of music and to connect with the full albums and not just the songs you like. Plus, they sometimes
                        have hidden sings etched on vinyl records.
