                        For ages, artists have been releasing their albums as a vinyl record, but everyone preferred listening
                        to them on streaming platforms. Up until recently, the vinyl industry boomed its way to being a
                        popularized form of listening to music thanks to a wave of young generations taking interest.
                        Because of this, record stores have gained more popularity and recognition placing them centre
                        stage.

                    <p>
                        While this is great economically for record stores and artists, the uniqueness of a person owning a
                        collection of vinyl records has decreased and practically went mainstream. Young generations are
                        taking a whole new interest in vinyl records at the same time and has destructed the meaning of
                        uniqueness of vinyl collections. From a time of being special for owning records and hundreds of
                        them has merely become another common hobby like football or drawing.

                        While I do enjoy local record stores getting the recognition they obviously deserve, I get enraged
                        seeing influencers taking photoshoots at the shops to seem ‘aesthetic’ and ‘down to Earth.’ I doubt
                        they even know how to take care of one.
                        It is the reason these shops are booming in business, but the authenticity of these influencers is not
                        there. A record shop should not be used as an aesthetic photo studio just for likes and followers. It
                        should be a safe place for actual vinyl record lovers to enjoy their collecting and quiet space.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I do understand that record stores need the recognition for more people to notice them, but it is
                        also what is destroying having regular customers that actually visit to buy vinyl records and not just
                        post a picture of the vibe. This ties in with mainstream. The more people go there and start a
                        collection or just there to take a photo of the lovely scenery, people might think it is becoming too
                        mainstream to even have it as a hobby. It is never going to be popular where people should get into
                        it like football, but it will never be as unique again because people know more about it like fencing.

                        Overall, I do not believe vinyl records are becoming fully mainstream, but it is certainly becoming
                        more common and popular to own a basic artists vinyl and a Crossley record player. Not knowing or
                        learning the full knowledge of the vinyl record and not really bothering to. Hopefully in the future,
                        people would take interest in collecting and learning the full history and how to take care of vinyl
                        records. Rather than just posing with the album cover for an Instagram post.
